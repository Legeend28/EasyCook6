# EasyCook4
A simple Python application designed to streamline asset cooking for Unreal Engine 4, primarily for modding purposes.

## Why bother?
Traditionally, cooking assets in Unreal relies on placing the assets you want cooked into maps, then specifying that map in the cooking process, this often results in unnecessary cooking of additional shaders, assets, and other content you don’t actually need. This wastes both **time** and **resources**.

**EasyCook** solves this by letting you specify exactly which assets or folders to cook. With its convenient GUI, you can:
* Select only what you need to cook nothing extra.
* Save and load profiles to avoid retyping commands or digging through old messages.
* Speed up your workflow and focus on modding, not setup.

## Installation
* **Executable Release**: A prebuilt `.exe` is available in the [Releases]([(https://github.com/magxut/EasyCook4/releases/tag/exe)) section. This version does **not** require Python to be installed.
* **Python Script**: If you’d like to run or modify the source directly, you can execute the Python script. For this option, you’ll need a local Python installation.
